# 🕯️ Kwanzaa Model — First Fruits for AI

**First Fruits for AI — grounded knowledge, cultural integrity, and community power.**

Kwanzaa is an **open, culturally grounded RAG + model adapter project** built on **AINative** to demonstrate how AI systems can deliver **trustworthy cultural intelligence** with citations, provenance, and respect.

This repository is intentionally open.  
It is designed for **builders, educators, researchers, creators, and community contributors** to participate.

---

## 🌍 Why This Project Exists

Most AI systems:
- flatten culture into vibes
- hallucinate historical facts
- hide sources
- reward confidence over correctness

**Kwanzaa is different by design.**

It enforces:
- primary sources
- provenance-first retrieval
- transparent uncertainty
- reusable RAG patterns
- respectful cultural handling

This repo is a **working proof** that cultural intelligence can be built **ethically, technically, and collaboratively**.

## 🧭 Guiding Framework: Nguzo Saba → Engineering Rules

Kwanzaa is guided by the **Seven Principles (Nguzo Saba)** — not as branding, but as system constraints.

| Principle | What It Means in Code |
|---------|-----------------------|
| **Umoja (Unity)** | Unified schemas, namespaces, and UX across personas |
| **Kujichagulia (Self-Determination)** | User-controlled citation + creativity toggles |
| **Ujima (Collective Work)** | Logged ingestion, auditable changes, open contributions |
| **Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics)** | Open artifacts, reusable datasets, shared credit |
| **Nia (Purpose)** | Education + research first, not content farming |
| **Kuumba (Creativity)** | Creator tools grounded in retrieved context |
| **Imani (Faith)** | Trust through citations, provenance, and refusal |

## 🧠 Core Concepts (Quick Primer)

### 📦 “First Fruits” Corpus

A **small, high-signal, provenance-rich dataset**:

* public domain
* government archives
* university collections
* historically grounded texts

This is intentional.
Quality > quantity.

---

### 🧠 RAG, Not Guessing

Every answer:

* retrieves documents
* scores them
* cites them
* shows what’s missing

If the corpus doesn’t support a claim, the system **says so**.

---

### 🧾 “Show Your Work” Is Mandatory

Each response includes:

* Answer
* Sources
* Retrieval summary
* Unknowns / gaps

No black boxes.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Developers)

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kwanzaa-model
cd kwanzaa-model
```

### 2. Read These Files (In Order)

1. `PRD_KWANZAA_MODEL.md`
2. `DATA_INGESTION_PRD_KWANZAA_FIRST_FRUITS.md`
3. `ZERODB_DATA_MODEL_KWANZAA.md`
4. `ANSWER_JSON_CONTRACT_KWANZAA.json`
5. `AGENTS.md`

This order matters.

## 📚 Contributing Data (Highly Encouraged)

You **do not need to be an engineer** to contribute.

### What You Can Contribute

* public-domain documents
* primary source archives
* curated reading lists
* curriculum materials
* metadata cleanup
* evaluation questions

### How to Contribute Data

1. Add a source to:

   ```
   manifest/FIRST_FRUITS_MANIFEST.json
   ```
2. Include:

   * license
   * canonical URL
   * source organization
3. Open a PR with:

   * why it matters
   * what persona it helps

📖 See `docs/CONTRIBUTING_DATA.md` for full guidelines.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Quality

We measure success by:

* citation coverage (educator/research modes)
* retrieval hit rate
* demo reliability per persona
* refusal correctness when data is missing

You can contribute:

* new eval questions
* failure cases
* red-team prompts
* bias audits

---

## 🛠️ How Else You Can Help

* File issues (bugs, gaps, UX problems)
* Improve documentation
* Propose new collections
* Add adapters or eval harnesses
* Review PRs
* Improve accessibility or language clarity

No contribution is too small.

---

## 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Community Norms

This project:

* centers Black American history and culture
* rejects stereotype reinforcement
* values accuracy over speed
* credits contributors
* welcomes critique in good faith

We will not merge:

* hallucinated content
* culture cosplay
* unlicensed data
* performative dialect
* unverifiable claims

---

## 📜 License & Attribution

* Code: Apache 2.0 (unless otherwise noted)

* Adapters: Open for reuse with attribution

All sources remain attributed to their original owners.

---

## 🕯️ Final Note

Kwanzaa is not just a model.

It is:

* a **cultural knowledge contract**
* a **technical standard**
* a **community experiment**

If you believe AI should be **accountable, respectful, and shared**,
you’re in the right place.

**Welcome to the work.**

```

If you want next, I can:
- write `CONTRIBUTING_DATA.md`
- generate a GitHub issue template (data / bugs / research gaps)
- add a CODEOWNERS + review flow
- draft a short “Why This Matters” page for non-technical contributors
```
