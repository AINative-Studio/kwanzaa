Virginia decision [1].\n\nHistorical Context:\nFollowing the 1960 Supreme Court decision in Boynton v. Virginia, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) organized interracial groups to ride buses through the South to test compliance with the ruling [2]. This provided a direct challenge to continued segregation in interstate bus travel.\n\nThe Freedom Rides were thus a strategic form of nonviolent direct action designed to force federal enforcement of existing civil rights law.",

This phrase captures the deliberate, conscious nature of her resistance\u2014it was an act of moral exhaustion with injustice rather than physical fatigue.\n\nHer arrest that day catalyzed the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a 381-day mass protest that became a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement.",
