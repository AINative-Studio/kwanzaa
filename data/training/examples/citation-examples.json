These values, the Nguzo Saba or Seven Principles, are not new creations but ancient truths given new voice.\n\nTonight, we light these candles not as mere symbols, but as commitments. Each flame represents a principle our ancestors lived by, struggled for, and passed down so we might thrive. We gather in their honor, in their memory, and in their spirit—knowing that the work of building beloved community continues with each of us.\"\n\n---\n\nThis introduction grounds your speech in the historical purpose of Kwanzaa while maintaining a reverent, ceremonial tone.
