Each flame represents a principle our ancestors lived by, struggled for, and passed down so we might thrive. We gather in their honor, in their memory, and in their spirit—knowing that the work of building beloved community continues with each of us.\"\n\n---\n\nThis introduction grounds your speech in the historical purpose of Kwanzaa while maintaining a reverent, ceremonial tone.

She explained that her refusal was not due to physical tiredness at the end of a workday. Rather, as she stated, she was \"tired of giving in\" [1]. This phrase captures the deliberate, conscious nature of her resistance—it was an act of moral exhaustion with injustice rather than physical fatigue.\n\nHer arrest that day catalyzed the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a 381-day mass protest that became a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement.",
