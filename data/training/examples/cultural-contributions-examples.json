She performed gospel music with a rock edge, influencing artists like Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Her 1938 recording 'Rock Me' and 1945 'Strange Things Happening Every Day' featured distorted electric guitar that predated rock and roll by a decade.",

          "text": "Hip-hop originated on **August 11, 1973**, in the West Bronx, New York, at **1520 Sedgwick Avenue** during a back-to-school party hosted by DJ Kool Herc (Clive Campbell) for his sister Cindy [1]. This event is widely recognized by music historians as hip-hop's birth.\n\n**The Founding Trinity:**\n\n1. **DJ Kool Herc (Clive Campbell)** - The Originator\n   - Pioneered the 'breakbeat' technique: isolating and extending instrumental break sections using two turntables [1]\n   - Created the foundation for hip-hop DJing and breakdancing (b-boying) [1]\n   - Jamaican immigrant who brought sound system culture to the Bronx [1]\n\n2. **Afrika Bambaataa** - The Educator and Organizer\n   - Founded the Universal Zulu Nation (1973), transforming hip-hop into a conscious cultural movement [2]\n   - Codified hip-hop's **Four Elements**: DJing, MCing (rapping), B-boying (breakdancing), and Graffiti Art [2]\n   - Promoted hip-hop as a positive alternative to gang violence [2]\n\n3. **Grandmaster Flash** - The Technical Innovator\n   - Advanced DJing technology with innovations like backspin, punch phrasing, and scratching [2]\n   - Created techniques that became hip-hop's sonic signature [2]\n\n**Sociohistorical Context:**\n\nHip-hop emerged from the South Bronx during extreme urban crisis\u2014devastation from white flight, arson schemes, and the Cross-Bronx Expressway's construction which destroyed stable Black and Latino neighborhoods [3]. Facing poverty and gang violence, youth created hip-hop as cultural resistance and creative expression at block parties and parks, often powering equipment by tapping street lamp electricity [3].\n\nHip-hop represents both artistic innovation (Kuumba) and self-determination (Kujichagulia)\u2014creating culture and identity despite systemic neglect.",

While Black artists like Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard created rock and roll, white artists like Elvis Presley achieved far greater commercial success due to deliberate racial barriers.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n1. **Radio Segregation**\n   - Stations divided music into 'race records' (Black artists) vs. mainstream (white artists) [1]\n   - Black artists were excluded from mainstream radio regardless of talent [1]\n\n2. **Industry Strategy**\n   - Record executives intentionally sought white performers to make Black music 'palatable' to white audiences [1]\n   - Sam Phillips of Sun Records famously said: 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars' [1]\n   - Elvis became that artist, achieving success by performing Black musical styles [1]\n\n3. **Systematic Exploitation**\n   - Black artists faced predatory contracts with no royalty protections [2]\n   - Little Richard sold 'Tutti Frutti' rights for $50 and received no royalties despite massive success [2]\n   - Chuck Berry fought years-long legal battles for songwriting credits [2]\n   - Sister Rosetta Tharpe never received adequate recognition or compensation [2]\n\n4. **Segregation's Impact**\n   - White artists covering Black songs received radio play, TV appearances, and financial rewards denied to Black originators [2]\n   - Even inferior covers by white artists outsold the original Black versions [2]\n\nThis pattern illustrates how racism steals not just credit but economic opportunity from Black innovators. Many Black rock pioneers died in poverty while white artists covering their work became millionaires. Understanding this history helps us recognize ongoing cultural appropriation and work toward equitable recognition of Black creativity.",

His traffic signal design was purchased by General Electric and became the basis for modern traffic control systems. Earlier, in 1914, Morgan invented the 'Safety Hood,' a smoke protection device (gas mask) that saved countless lives. He personally used it to rescue workers trapped in a tunnel explosion in Cleveland in 1916, though he had to pretend to be 'Big Chief Mason' because officials wouldn't trust a Black man's invention.",
