          "text": "Umoja (oo-MOH-jah) is the Swahili word for \"Unity,\" and it's the first of the Seven Principles of Kwanzaa. Here's what it means in a way that connects to your life:\n\nThe Big Idea:\nUmoja means working together as a team [1]. It teaches us that we're stronger when we support each other\u2014in our families, schools, communities, and as a people. Think of it like this: one stick breaks easily, but a bundle of sticks is much harder to break.\n\nHow It Works in Real Life:\nUnity starts at home with your family [2]. When you:\n- Help with chores even when it's not \"your turn\"\n- Share resources with your siblings\n- Support your family members when they're having a hard day\n- Work together to solve problems\n\n...you're practicing Umoja! Each person's contribution matters, and the whole family is stronger because everyone participates [2].\n\nWhy It Matters:\nUmoja reminds us that individual success is important, but community strength is essential [1]. When your whole community is doing well\u2014when neighbors help each other, when people work together for common goals\u2014everyone benefits.\n\nThink about your classroom: when students help each other learn instead of competing, everyone understands the material better. That's Umoja in action!",

          "text": "Kwanzaa's creation in 1966 emerged from a specific constellation of historical forces in the mid-1960s Black Freedom Movement:\n\nImmediate Context - Watts Rebellion (1965):\nDr. Maulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in 1966 following the Watts Rebellion of August 1965 [1][3]. The rebellion exposed deep systemic inequalities facing Black communities in urban America, and its aftermath prompted community leaders to seek constructive approaches to rebuild and strengthen community bonds [3].\n\nIdeological Context - Black Power Movement:\nKwanzaa was philosophically rooted in the cultural dimension of the Black Power Movement [2]. This movement emphasized the necessity for African Americans to engage in cultural self-definition rather than merely reacting to oppression [2]. Karenga designed Kwanzaa as a \"proactive cultural practice\" that enabled African Americans to celebrate themselves and their culture on their own terms [2].\n\nPurpose and Vision:\nThe holiday was explicitly created to:\n1. Bring African Americans together as a unified community [1]\n2. Reaffirm bonds with each other [1]\n3. Reconnect with African heritage and culture [1]\n4. Move beyond reactive opposition to a stance of cultural affirmation [2]\n\nHistorical Significance:\nKwanzaa represented a synthesis of resistance and reconstruction\u2014acknowledging the struggles of the 1960s while providing a framework for cultural continuity and community building [1]. It emerged as part of the broader project of Black cultural nationalism that characterized the late 1960s.\n\nThe timing and context are essential: Kwanzaa was not created in a vacuum but as a direct response to both the trauma of urban rebellion and the possibilities of cultural self-determination.",

Seven Symbol Types [1]:\n   - Mkeka (mat) - base element\n   - Kinara (candleholder) - structural container\n   - Mishumaa Saba (seven candles) - stateful elements\n   - Muhindi (corn) - dynamic count based on children\n   - Kikombe cha Umoja (unity cup) - single element\n   - Zawadi (gifts) - collection type\n   - Mazao (crops) - collection type\n\n2. Candle State Management [2]:\n   - Total: 7 candles with specific colors\n   - Color schema: 1 black (center), 3 red (left), 3 green (right)\n   - Position system: center-outward arrangement\n   - State tracking: lit/unlit per day\n\n3. Lighting Sequence Logic [2]:\n   - Day 1 (Dec 26): Black candle (center position)\n   - Days 2-7: Alternating red/green, moving outward\n   - Sequence pattern: center \u2192 left \u2192 right \u2192 left \u2192 right \u2192 left \u2192 right\n\nImplementation Requirements:\n\n```\nInterface: KwanzaaDisplay {\n  symbols: Symbol[]\n  currentDay: 1-7\n  candleStates: CandleState[]\n  \n  methods:\n    - initializeDisplay()\n    - lightCandle(day: number)\n    - getCandleSequence(day: number): CandlePosition\n    - renderSymbols()\n}\n\nInterface CandleState {\n  position: \"center\" | \"left-1\" | \"left-2\" | \"left-3\" | \"right-1\" | \"right-2\" | \"right-3\"\n  color: \"black\" | \"red\" | \"green\"\n  isLit: boolean\n  lightingDay: 1-7\n}\n```\n\nValidation Rules:\n- Enforce 7-symbol minimum [1]\n- Validate candle arrangement pattern [2]\n- Ensure proper lighting sequence [2]\n- Handle dynamic Muhindi count based on context\n\nThis structure ensures cultural accuracy while providing flexibility for various display implementations (web, mobile, AR, etc.).",
