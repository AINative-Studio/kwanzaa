* **Answer**

  * Render `answer.text` as the main response
  * Optionally display `confidence` as a badge or tooltip

* **Sources**

  * Render each entry in `sources` as a clickable citation
  * Group by `source_org` or `namespace` if desired

* **Retrieval Summary**

  * Collapsible section
  * Show `query`, `top_k`, filters
  * Display top results with rank, score, snippet, and links

* **Unknowns**

  * Only render if any arrays are non-empty
  * Use as a trust signal (“Here’s what’s missing or unclear”)

* **Integrity**

  * Can drive UI badges:

    * “Citations required: ✓”
    * “Retrieval confidence: High”
